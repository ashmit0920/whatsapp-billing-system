# whatsapp-billing-system

## Under Early stage development
A convenient service for businesses to send the billing details of customers to their whatsapp numbers. Currently doesn't include inventory integration due to non-uniformity in billing softwares used by stores. Similar programs are already used by most of the major retail chains/online stores.

The goal is to build this into a full-fledged billing software with automated payment reminders and customised infographics for customer databases.

Built using Flask and Twilio's Whatsapp Business API.

Note: You need to have a Twilio account and registered API tokens, currently works for sandbox registered numbers only as its under development.
